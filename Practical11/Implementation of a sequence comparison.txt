Result:
the BLOSUM matrix shows:
Between human and mouse, the given protein alignment is 1091;
between human and ramdon protein, the given protein alignment is -250;
between mouse and ramdon protein, the given protein alignment is -250.
In the comparison of amino acid sequences, human's and mouse's single acids have a high similarity of 89.64% that are ientical.
As control groups, human's and mouse's acid sequences are conpared to a random sequence seperately, but their similarities are both around 5%.
These data show that human and mice may have a great possibility of relationship in the origin and ancestors.
But due to many reasons, we evolved into two very different species. In other words, we usually use mice for experiments and research, 
not only because they are small in size, with less hair and short hair, which makes it easy to see the reaction and easy to operate, 
but also because the body structure of mice is similar to that of human beings, which is more conducive to research on human beings.
In my opinion, mice and human could be kind of far far related in the origin of species.
